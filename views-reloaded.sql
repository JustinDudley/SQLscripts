select * from fullrequests;  --it looks like fullrequest is a table.  It's not. 
-- it's a view.  A view is a pre-built query
--if you're using a lot of dfdfdfd, ikt's worthwhile to put together dfdfsdf to fffasdfsf
-- And that's all there is to views.  We created this new query right after doing something with
-- a view


select * from fullrequests--where requestid = 3;
